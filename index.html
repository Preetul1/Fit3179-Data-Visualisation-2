        <h1>Exploring the Geography of AFL Competition and Home Advantage</h1>
        <p>This page explores the geographical aspects of the AFL competition, fan attendance, and the concept of home advantage.
          The Australian Foowtball League (AFL) is the premier professional competition for Australian rules football, a sport deeply
          embedded in Australia's sporting culture. The AFL has since grown into a national league featuring teams from across the country.
          Its matches attract millions of fans each year, with strong local followings and distinctive home-ground dynamics that shape both team performance and spectator engagement.

        <h2> Match Distribution</h2>
        <p> AFL matches are played all around Australia, however as it can be highlighted in the map majority of the games 
        are played in the southeastern stateof Victoria. This is due to the fact that most
        of the AFL teams are based here and the sport has a strong following in this region.

        <h2> Match Hosting and Attendance
        </h2>
        <p>The hosting of matches over the years has not changed and stayed consistent as each state has roughly the same 
          number of games being hosted every year, whilst attendance has been steadily rising. Interestingly in 2020 there was a significant drop in the number of games hosted as
          well as fan attendance naturally due to Covid 19 restrictions. However most matches were held in Queensland seeing a signoficant
          increase in games hosted there compared to other years.</p>

        <h2> Home Turf Advantage
        </h2>
        <p> The data indicates the Home teams often have the higher chance of coming out on top. More
          games are won by the home team and often the hom team also has a higher margin of winning compared to away teams.
